My First Repository

Hello,

My name is Trevor. I'm married to my amazing wife Sarah, and we just had a baby girl 4 months ago! I graduated in 2013 from the University of Michigan with a degree in Civil Engineering, then worked for 7 years in campus ministry as a worship leader. Now, I'm looking to get into web development, and taking bootcamps on Udemy.
